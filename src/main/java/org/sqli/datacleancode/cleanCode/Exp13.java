 *
 * Design carefully methods signature (params) => THE BEST METHODS HAVE NO PARAMS
 *
 * Use varargs
 *
 * Return empty collections/arrays, Optional in case of objects
 *
 * Minimize the scone of local variables
 *
 * prefer for-each
 *
 * Refer to objects by their interfaces
 *
 * Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction
 *
 * Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction ==> infos
 *
 * Don't ignore exception => ignoring exceptions is like ignoring fire alarm
 *
 * Avoid Float & Double If Exact Answers Are Required (Use BigDecimal)
 *
 * Beware the performance of string concatenation => Use StringBuilder
